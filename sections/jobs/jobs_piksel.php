                                    Here at Piksel, we design, build and run high-end video and entertainment products and services such as Sky Go, 4oD, Demand Five, iPlayer and for clients such as AT&T, BSkyB, Mediaset, OSN, Liberty Global and Sky Deutschland, as well as enterprise brands like Airbus, Barnes & Noble, and Volkswagen.

                                    We make our living doing what we enjoy – writing software to help world class organisations push the boundaries of technology.
                                    Top to bottom and front to back, we can cover all the bases for our clients and by doing so we offer varied and exciting opportunities for all our teams.
                                    We have code being designed and built to run on Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, Xbox, PlayStation, connected televisions, set top boxes, smart watches, and many more platforms.
                                    We do things the right way – solid engineering practice is our passion.
                                    If you know that design patterns, unit testing, continuous integration, DevOps and continuous delivery are not buzzwords but are “must haves” then you will fit in here, so please get in touch.

                                    We are currently looking for a bright, enthusiastic Full Stack Technical Lead based in our Malaga office.
