                    <a href='http://www.intellimentsec.com/' target='_blank'>Intelliment</a> is a Spanish company that provides an abstract and intelligent control plane for the management and provision of security policies of a network, in a vendor, technology and network topology independent way through both, programmable and visual interfaces. In the market this is called a Software Defined Security Controller.

                    <br /><br />
                    Basically, Intelliment is doing for security what Puppet did for systems’ automation,
                    helping the largest organizations with the most complicated security policies.
                    Intelliment has removed the drivers that cause management complexity growth.

                            <p>
                            The capability of getting things done with the highest standards, being a self-driven employee. We value both aptitude and attitude as well as experience

                            On a personal level you should have good written and oral communication skills. We like employees to be involved in conferences, open source or community-driven projects, and so every employee is a spokesperson for the company at all times. Both oral and written english is a must
                            </p>
                        </li>
