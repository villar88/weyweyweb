                    "The future direction of the architecture of micro services is becoming increasingly clear around the ability to handle elasticity and resilience at scale, while maintaining isolation of API, source code and data. This talk will discuss Lightbend's journey
                    in developing languages, frameworks and tools to meet our vision of how applications should be responsive to users via elasticity and resilience, and finish with a real-world use case at a large company in deconstructing a JEE monolith,
                    and how that could similarly be achieved with Lightbend's new opinionated microservices framework, Lagom."
